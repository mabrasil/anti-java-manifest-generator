# Anti Java Text Generator

This is just a (serious) joke app that generates Lorem Ipsum-like texts with some bad aspects of the Java language.

> Note: Keep calm Java-guys. I also appreciate Java! This app doesn't mean to be partial: it is just intended
to bring to discussion some bad (or not so-good) aspects of the Java language.
